# vm-ui


## Setting up the app
1. Clone project repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/50enta/vm-ui.git
```

2. Install dependencies
```
npm install --force
```
By running `npm install` is enough to ensure dependencies will be installed, but just to make sure i added `--force` arguments.

3. Execute project on development mode
```
npm start
```
The project will be running on 3000 port: `http://localhost:3000`


Note:
> Didn't create .env file, the endpoint, token, etc to connect with API are managed on the code as well.
>> Also to make the authentication proccess easy, on login page validation are disabled. Just click login button and it will work.
